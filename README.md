This repository contains the step-by-step assignments and practice projects completed during my 1-year Cyber Security & Artificial Intelligence course at Mars Tech Pvt Ltd**.
Each assignment is uploaded in sequence as part of my learning journey, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.
The purpose of this repository is to track my progress, improve my hands-on skills, and build a strong foundation in Cyber Security and AI.
All projects are created for educational purposes and will be updated regularly as I continue learning.
